# I Stand

A web component to embed in your personal site to show you stand with the protests against racism and police brutality.

![A banner showing solidarity with protestors against police brutality](./screenshot.png)

To add this banner to your site, include the following code:

```html
<!-- Somewhere in your page -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/i-stand/black-lives.js" type="module"></script>

<!-- After the opening <body> tag -->
<black-lives></black-lives>
```

The snippet above will always use the latest version of the banner. This means if any changes are published they'll automatically be pulled in (such as new names or updated links).

If you want to use a specific version, you can update the [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) url to point to a specific version. For example, to always use the `v1.1.0` release, include the following script instead:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/i-stand@1.1.0/black-lives.js" type="module"></script>
```

_This should work in all modern browsers. If you need to support legacy browsers, you may need to include some polyfills or run the script through a transpiler, like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), first._

Created CSS variables to allow the user to easily style this component. The user can utilize these new variables by simply adding `<style>
      black-lives {
        --name-font-size: 20px;
      }
    </style>` into the head of their html file.
The following CSS variables are now available:
-  --name-font-size
-  --font-family
-  --background-color
-  --links-color
-  --color
-  --line-height
-  --width
-  --padding
